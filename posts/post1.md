# The Beginning: Building Public Thinking

I’m using this repo as a public lab for ideas — poker, crypto, risk, and decision-making. 
Short notes over perfect essays. Iterations over illusions of final truth.

**Principles**
- Ship small, often.
- Write what I’m testing, not what I’ve “solved”.
- Track assumptions, change my mind in public.

**Why here?**
Because code isn’t the only thing that benefits from version control — thinking does too.

First commit to better reasoning. Let’s see how far this repo can evolve.
Add first post.
